# Celestial Engine
A 2D deferred-rendered .NET game engine designed for programmers with advanced lighting, shadows, and physics.

Development of Celestial Engine was started in 2012 to create a simple framework to allow quick prototyping of simple game concepts for people with programming backgrounds. This project has slowly evolved over time in very short spurts as interest allowed.
