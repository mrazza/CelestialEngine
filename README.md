# Celestial Engine
[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/celestialengine/CelestialEngine/_apis/build/status/mrazza.CelestialEngine?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/celestialengine/CelestialEngine/_build/latest?definitionId=3&branchName=master)

A 2D deferred-rendered .NET game engine designed for programmers with advanced lighting, shadows, and physics.

Development of Celestial Engine was started in 2012 to create a simple framework to allow quick prototyping of simple game concepts for people with programming backgrounds. This project has slowly evolved over time in very short spurts as interest allowed.

To build this project (and the MonoGame Content projects) you'll need MonoGame installed: http://www.monogame.net/downloads/  

This was last built with 3.6.X and takes a dependency on MonoGame through NuGet.

*Pre-alpha* NuGet package is available at https://www.nuget.org/packages/CelestialEngine.Net45/
